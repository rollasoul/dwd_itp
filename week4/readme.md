# mongo-db exercise
Repo should work fine, db_config.js is ignored in git-push as it contains mongodb username and pw:
create it in week3 folder with nano or touch and write/add your db-username/pw:
```javascript
var config = {
        mlabstring: "<dbusername>:<user-password>@<db-URL>:<port>/<db-name>"
 }
 module.exports = config
```
